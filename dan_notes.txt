For the resume generator, I often find myself wanting to do some repetitive things.  Variables or function/macro syntax would make certain things much easier.  E.g., I sometimes refer to the same thing in multiple places.  I use LaTeX for my own CV because I can define all of these things, but I do find CV layout to be annoying and fiddly.  Your project might make it easy for somebody to just apply a new "look" to their resume easily.
