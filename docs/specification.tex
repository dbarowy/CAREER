\title{CAREER (Comprehensive Automated Resume \& Employment Experience Renderer) Language Specification}

\author{Harry Albert}

\begin{document}
  
\maketitle

\subsection*{Introduction}
Creating a beautiful resume is often tedious and time consuming, but this annoying task is unfortunately extremely important. Making your resume look professional and easily readable can be the difference between a recruiter considering you for a job and throwing your application away. Formatting a resume well entails taking the time to organize your experience, skills, and interests in an aesthetically pleasing way using an often uncooperative word editing software. This means that making a resume can be both time consumign and painful, while still mandatory for career goals. \\

CAREER solves this issue by automatically formatting your information for you, taking as input some simple text and outputting a well designed resume. CAREER will always output a visually pleasing and readable product, without the fuss and frustration of actually formatting everything yourself.  This also allows for the easy modification of one's resume without the need to go back and reformat everything. In summary, CAREER saves time by making resume creation a breeze, democratizing quality resume creation by putting a well formatted resume at anyone's fingertips. \\

Compiling a CAREER formatted text file will result in a well formatted LaTeX file, with the same name as the inputted text file and in the same location. If you have pdflatex installed (\url{https://tug.org/texlive/}), this LaTeX file will be automatically compiled to a pdf file (again, with the same name and in the same location as the inputted text file). You can also copy and paste the resulting LaTeX file into \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{overleaf} if you don't want to download a compiler.

\subsection*{Design Principles}
The main goal of CAREER's design is to be easily readable and modifiable by the user. Any user who has skimmed over CAREER's documentation should be able to easily read and understand a resume written in CAREER. Users should be able to go back to their resume document after not looking at it for a year and quickly find and update whatever has changed in that time. This means that all of CAREER's commands and functions should be easily readable and understandable, ideally with little reference to the documentation. The other main design principle guiding CAREER is conciceness. One of the problems CAREER is solving is that resume writing is tedious and time consuming. Requiring the user to write lots of boiler plate code to create a CAREER resume would not fix this problem.

\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{center}
	\textbf{Example 1:}
\end{center}
This is an example of a very simple resume that one could imagine a higschooler making. While this resume is very spare, it is still well formatted, and could serve as a good starting point to build off of in the future.\\
\textbf{To run: } Go into `./code/lang` and run `dotnet run ./examples/example\_1/example\_1.txt` (Note: when you copy and paste from latex, the underscores are replaced with spaces. Make sure to include the above underscores in your terminal command).\\

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Example 2:}
\end{center}
This example program is a more complex iteration of the above problem. One might imagine this as the second version of a student's resume once they've entered college. This example uses a bit more of the formatting options available in CAREER and is thus more complex, but still very readable. \\
\textbf{To run: } Go into `./code/lang` and run `dotnet run ./examples/example\_2/example\_2.txt` (Note: when you copy and paste from latex, the underscores are replaced with spaces. Make sure to include the above underscores in your terminal command).\\

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Example 3:}
\end{center}
This final example makes use of all of the functionality available in CAREER to make a complex and well formatted resume. However, this resume is still very readable and editable over time. One could imagine this as the resume of a graduating college student or working professional. This example is actually a shortened version of my Resume. If you want to see a full version of this resume written and compiled with CAREER, go to `./code/lang/examples/resume`. \\
\textbf{To run: } Go into `./code/lang` and run `dotnet run ./examples/example\_3/example\_3.txt` (Note: when you copy and paste from latex, the underscores are replaced with spaces. Make sure to include the above underscores in your terminal command).\\

\subsection*{Language Concepts}
The core concept of this language is that there are modifiers and text. Text is a primitive, and it is defined as any string that is not a modifier. For example,  in the line "HEADER Harry Albert," "Harry Albert" is the text. Modifiers are (conventionally all caps) functions, indiciated by *, that change how text is displayed. For example, the SECTION modifier bolds the text that follows it and adds a horizontal line above it to indicate a new section. Ideally, users will be able to create their own modifiers to make the language more groweable. The ITEM function is a special modifier function that can only be applied to the start of a line. Finally, modifiers can be stacked. For example, ITEM creates a bullet pointed text, and BOLD (used within an item) creates a bolded piece of text. When brackets are included after a modifier, the modifier will apply only to the text included in the brackets. If brackets are not included, the modifier will apply to all text until a new line.

\subsection*{Semantics}

\subsubsection*{Expression}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
$<$line$>^+$

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}:
Expression of Line list

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
1/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
An expression is simply a list of lines. Each CAREER ast is composed of one expression. This one expression holds all of the lines that were given as an input and will eventually be outputted as formatted LaTeX.


\subsubsection*{Line}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
*ITEM\textvisiblespace$<$formatted\_text$>^+$ \textbackslash n \\
$|$ *SUBSECTION\_TITLE \textvisiblespace$<$subsection\_content$>^+$ \textbackslash n \\
$| <$formatted\_text$>^+$ \textbackslash n

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}:
Line of FormattedText list

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
2/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
One line in CAREER represents one input line in the given text file and one output line in the resulting tex/pdf file. A line is simply a list of formatted texts, meaning a list of modifiers and strings. A line is stopped by the new line character, and outputs a string with a new line character at the end.


\subsubsection*{Formatted Text}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
$<$modifier$>$ $|$ $<$string$>$

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}:
FormattedText of Modifier or String

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
3/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
FormattedText is essentially a container that can store either Modifiers or Strings. This is a necessary combining form because Modifiers must be able to be applied to other modifiers. Thus, modifiers are applied to lists of formatted texts, and each formatted text can store either a modifier or a string.


\subsubsection*{Item Modifier}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
*LINE \textvisiblespace $<$formatted\_text$>$

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}: 
Modifier of string * (FormattedText list)

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
4/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
Item is a special modifier that puts an entire line into bullet point format. Because of this, Item (unlike other modifiers) cannot be applied anywhere within a line; it can only be applied at the start of a line. Thus, the line modifier has its own, special syntax that is taken into account by the Line combining form.


\subsubsection*{Subsection Title Modifier}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
*SUBSECTION\_TITLE \textvisiblespace $<$string$>$ \\
$|$ *SUBSECTION\_TITLE \textvisiblespace [$<$string$>$] \\
$|$ *SUBSECTION\_TITLE \textvisiblespace [$<$string$>$]\textvisiblespace[$<$string$>$] \\
$|$ *SUBSECTION\_TITLE \textvisiblespace [$<$string$>$]\textvisiblespace[$<$string$>$]\textvisiblespace[$<$string$>$]

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}: 
Modifier of string * (FormattedText list)

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
5/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
The subsection title modifier is another special modifier. This modifier can also only be applied at the beginning of a line. It takes one to three arguments, all of which must be Strings. These arguments must be surrounded by brackets to deliniate between each argument. If there are no brackets, CAREER will assume the entire string after the modifying function is one argument. Given one argument, CAREER centers the given text, bolded and underlined, on a line. Given two arguments, the modifier places the first argument bolded on the left side of the line and the second argument bolded on the right side. Finally, given three arguments, CAREER places the first and third argument bolded on the left/right side of the line, and the second argument bolded and underlined in the middle.


\subsubsection*{Modifier}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
*$<$modifying\_function$>$\textvisiblespace[$<$formatted\_text$>^+$] $|$ $<$modifying\_function$>$\textvisiblespace$<$formatted\_text$>^+$ 

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}: 
Modifier of String * (FormattedText list)

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
6/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
A modifier stores some modifying command and a list of formatted texts to apply this modifying command to. Each of these formatted texts must eventually evaluate to a string, and each of the strings in the formatted text list will be combined into one final string. This string will have the modifying function applied to it in the corresponding LaTeX code. For example, the modifying function BOLD applies \textbackslash textbf to all of its inner formatted texts.


\subsubsection*{Modifying Function}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
HEADER $|$ SUBHEADER $|$ SECTION $|$ BOLD $|$ UNDERLINE $|$ LINK

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}: 
string

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
7/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
A modifying function is a command that tells CAREER how to format some following formatted text. What each of these modifying functions does should be clear from their naming. Modifying functions are preceded by the * character when used in a full modifier. This allows for the distinction between modifying functions and normal strings.


\subsubsection*{String}
\textbf{Syntax}: 
$<$string$>$

\textbf{Abstract Syntax}: 
String of string

\textbf{Prec./Assoc.}: 
8/left

\textbf{Meaning}:
A string is, as you might expect, a string. It can contain any characters besides \textbackslash n, *, [, and ]. Each of these characters is used for a specific purpose in CAREER and thus cannot be used in basic strings.
